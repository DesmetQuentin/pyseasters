Installation
============

.. seealso::

    Make sure first to clone PySEASTERS' Github repository,
    as explained :doc:`here <../user_guide/installation>`.


If you are a developer who wishes to contribute to PySEASTERS in any way, you must
follow a specific workflow which also has some tool dependendies. They are divided
into pure development tools (``dev``) and tools for generating the documentation
(``docs``). Install them using:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e </path/to/pyseasters>[dev,docs]
