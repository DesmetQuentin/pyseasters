Welcome to PySEASTERS documentation!
====================================

PySEASTERS is Python package providing a number of tools to support the SEASTERS
scientific project.


.. important::

    This package is not entirely public: a number of functions actually rely
    on the existence of **data and configuration files** which **are not provided**
    with the Python code.

    **However**, the fully functional SEASTERS framework **can be replicated** from
    the PySEASTERS code alone and the present documentation.
    All downloading and preprocessing functions are indeed transparently shared,
    and a guide to reconsitude our database is accessible
    :doc:`here <../user_guide/replicate_the_database>`.
