Welcome to PySEASTERS' documentation!
=====================================

This website covers the documentation on the pySEASTERS Python package, which provides a number of tools to support the SEASTERS scientific project.
Note that this package is not entirely public and notably relies on several data and configuration files which are kept private within the SEASTERS project.
There is also this other :doc:`page <page>`.
