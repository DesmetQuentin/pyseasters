Extended Southeast Asia
-----------------------

Data pages often refer to the *extended Southeast Asia*. This is a non-official term
that includes roughly **80째--150째 longitude and -20째--30째 latitude**.
Sometimes, data providers sort their files by territory rather than area,
(the "territory" term here, or "country", is employed as in, e.g., the
`ISO 3166 convention <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes>`_
and is different from "political state", meaning distinct territories may share
identical soveignty). In this case, *extended Southeast Asia* corresponds to the
following **list of territories**:
