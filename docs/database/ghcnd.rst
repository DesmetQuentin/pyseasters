.. epigraph::

   The Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) is an integrated database of
   daily climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe. GHCNd is made up
   of daily climate records from numerous sources that have been integrated and
   subjected to a common suite of quality assurance reviews.

   GHCNd contains records from more than 100,000 stations in 180 countries and
   territories. NCEI provides numerous daily variables, including maximum and minimum
   temperature, total daily precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth.
   About half the stations only report precipitation. Both record length and period of
   record vary by station and cover intervals ranging from less than a year to more than
   175 years.
